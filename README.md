## Blog Site

Getting started:
```
npm install
npm run build
npm run start
```

Built with:

- Next.js
- Ghost CMS
- Disqus comments feature

Posts can be directly managed with the backend CMS with ease.

*Not hosted on Netlify due to it having pages with dynamic routes (Next.js fallback function). Would require Vercel hosting instead.
